# A Yen for the Future

## Overview

In this repository, I test out time-series tools that I have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.

* Load historical Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data and apply time series analysis and modeling to determine whether there is any predictable behavior.
* Build a Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict Yen futures ("settle") returns with lagged Yen futures returns and categorical calendar seasonal effects (e.g., day-of-week or week-of-year seasonal effects).
